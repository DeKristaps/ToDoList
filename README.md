## To Do List

This is a simple angular application that can track tasks you need to do.

You can:
* add tasks
* delete tasks one by one or clear them all.
* Checked tasks ar crossed out.
* Finished tasks ar tracked at the bottom.


To run the app you will first need to run `npm install`.
After that you can run `ng serve` or if you are using any of the JetBrains products as your IDE, just hit Run.


Navigate to `http://localhost:4200` and have fun.
